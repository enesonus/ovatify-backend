# Contributing Guidelines for Ovatify

Welcome to the Ovatify project! This document provides a detailed guide on how to contribute to the project using Git and GitHub. Our workflow is designed to maintain a clean, linear history using branching and rebasing, avoiding merge commits in our project history.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Clone the Repository

To start, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enesonus/ovatify-backend.git
```

### Create a New Branch

For every new feature or bugfix, create a new branch with your task number (e.g. OVTF-1, OVTF-96). Please be sure that you are in `main` for plain (OVTF-1) branches and in `dev` for `-dev` (OVTF-1-dev) branches:

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b OVTF-TaskNum
```

or

```bash
git checkout dev
git checkout -b OVTF-TaskNum-dev
```

## Working on Your Feature

### Committing Changes

After you are done with the code you can commit it to your branch with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a concise and informative commit message"
```

### Fetching Latest Main Branch

Regularly fetch the latest changes:

```bash
git fetch --all
```

### Rebasing onto Main and Dev

Keep your feature branch updated by rebasing onto the main branch. For development branch (-dev) rebase accordingly:

Main:

```bash
git rebase origin/main
```

Dev:

```bash
git rebase origin/dev
```

If conflicts arise, resolve them (VS Code has a built in Merge editor for this), then continue rebasing:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

## Preparing to Merge

### Squashing Commits

Before merging, squash your commits into a single commit for a cleaner history:

```bash
git rebase -i <SHA of the latest commit before your commit>
```

In most terminals this command opens a CLI text editor (usually vim).  
- Press `i` to switch to insert mode
- For commits you created after the first commit, replace "pick" with "squash" (or "s").
- In order to save your work press ESC, write `:wq` (`w`rite and `q`uit) and press ENTER.
- At the second screen again write `:wq` and ENTER.

   Now you are done with squashing!

### Writing Good Commit Messages

- The first line should be a short summary of the changes, in the present tense.
- Leave a blank line after the summary.
- (Optional) Provide a detailed description of the changes on the following lines, wrapping the text at 72 characters.

Example:

```bash
OVTF-37: Implement user authentication
```

or

```bash
OVTF-37-dev: Implement user authentication
```

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

### Push Your Branch

- Push your branch to GitHub named with the task number (e.g. OVTF-1, OVTF-98):

```bash
git push -u origin OVTF-TaskNum
```

or

```bash
git push -u origin OVTF-TaskNum-dev
```

### Create a Pull Request

- Go to the repository on GitHub.
- Click on "Pull Request" and then "New Pull Request".
- Select your branch and provide a concise, informative description of your changes.

### Code Review

- Wait for a review from the team.
- Make any requested changes and re-push your branch.

### Final Rebase

   Before your PR is merged, ensure your branch is rebased onto the latest main branch:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

### Merge and Clean-Up

   After the PR is approved, the repository maintainer will merge the branch.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Code Style and Standards:**
  Adhere to the coding style and standards agreed upon by the team.

- **Testing:**
  Ensure your code is well-tested and follows the project's testing guidelines. :))

- **Documentation:**
  Update or add documentation as needed.

By following these guidelines, we maintain a clean, understandable history and ensure a consistent workflow for everyone contributing to the project. Thanks for contributing to Ovatify! ðŸŒŸ
